Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.

Mr. Buckner,

 For delivered gas behind San Diego, Enron Energy Services is the appropriate 
Enron entity.  I have forwarded your request to Zarin Imam at EES.  Her phone

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list

Phillip,
 Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list


From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
positions, I think we still have the following issues:
We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had 
three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
be outside the scope of position consolidation.

Things left to do:
I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
drill downs.
Use the above to formulate a project plan.

Things requested thus far (no particular order):
Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
ticker.
Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
add up existing position manager rows/columns).
New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
of all curves on which the desk has a position.
Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid 
would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
appropriate positions to show for each:
Gas Daily for monthly index,
Physical gas for Nymex,
Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
Physical gas for Mid market.
Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
using official valuations.
Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility 
skew and correlations.
Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  
Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
gamma grid.
Valuation of Gas Daily options.
A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.
Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
manager.
Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, 
prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.
Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
Benchmark positions in TDS.
Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit 
and explicit position break out issues.

-- Allan.

PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for 
transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that 
point.

Westgate

Enclosed are demographics on the Westgate site from Investor's Alliance.
Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package
on San Marcos that you received earlier.
If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.
Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?

San Marcos
The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for
sale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per square
foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West
San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.

Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes
and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25
per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and
$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This
property will have the best location for student housing of all new
projects, just as the duplexes do now.

If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there
is a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not
yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will
know more on this question later today.

Sincerely,

George W. Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

Liane,

 As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to 
manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  It appears that a single 
buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above 
market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades, 
offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were 
bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index 
calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated 
financial swaps for San Juan.

 We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from 
September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from 
Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage 
firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a 
trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas 
daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread 
relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:

 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater 
than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 

 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & 
Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and 
       October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that 
are dramatically different.


 I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the 
trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to 
determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are 
outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in 
establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at 
$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the 
calculation of index.

 It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to 
conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me 
anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

Sincerely,

Phillip Allen
