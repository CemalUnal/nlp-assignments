## Introduction

In this assignment I have used Python programming language (Python 3) along with TensorFlow (tensorflow 1.8.0) library.

## TensorFlow Functions and Utilities That I Used in My Assignment

#### tf.placeholder
In the TensorFlow documentation it says that `Placeholder inserts a placeholder for a tensor that will be always fed.` In simple words, a placeholder is simply a variable that we will assign data to at a later date. In my code, I did not know what the value of the array `x` and `y` would be during the declaration phase. So I defined them as placeholders.

For example `training_data_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 200])` and `output_data_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 2])`. Since I am not making any initialization in the declaration, TensorFlow needs to know what data type each element within the tensor is going to be. I am providing it by using `tf.float32`. `[None, 200]` is used to specify the shape of the data that will injected to this variable. I have used **None** since the size of the train and test matrices are different. And TensorFlow will decide it later on while execution.
